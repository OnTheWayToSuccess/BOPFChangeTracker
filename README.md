# BOPF Change Tracker
BOPF Change tracker is a tool which allows you to track any changes of any data in BOPF. We have similar functionality in BOPF Test UI but The Change tracker is much stronger and generic. 

Ways for installation:  
1. by ACP tool.  
2. manuall installation, in this way you should create DDIC, report and class manually. Files with source code for Addon class/report inside the folder. 
3. Using SAPLINK + a bit manuall installation.

# TODO:
Write a guide how to track node change without CT installation using standard watch points in BOPF Test UI.

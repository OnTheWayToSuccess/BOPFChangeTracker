# BOPFChangeTracker
BOPF Change tracker is a tool which allows you to track any changes of any data in BOPF. We have similar functionality in BOPF Test UI but The Change tracker is much stronger and generic.
Here we have 2 ways for installation of CT. The first one by ACP tool, the easiest way to install it. The second is for manuall installation, in this way you should create DDIC manually. Files with source code for Addon class/report inside the folder.
